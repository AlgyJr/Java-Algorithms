/**
 * <p>
 * In mathematics, an arithmetic progression (AP) or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the
 * difference between the consecutive terms is constant. Difference here means the second minus the first.
 * For instance, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, . . . is an arithmetic progression with common difference of 2.
